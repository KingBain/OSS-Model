    documentation="Where Appropriate and Where Possible are defined as all items that are not exempt due to the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Source Code is not owned exclusively by the Crown and is not already open-source.&#xD;&#xA;The Source Code is protected&#xD;&#xA;In order for source code to potentially be deemed protected, it would have to contain any of the following information:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Information that is deemed Classified&#xD;&#xA;Information obtained in confidence&#xD;&#xA;Information about federal-provincial affairs&#xD;&#xA;Information about international affairs and defence&#xD;&#xA;Information about law enforcement and investigations&#xD;&#xA;Information about the safety of individuals&#xD;&#xA;Information about the economic interests of Canada&#xD;&#xA;Personal information&#xD;&#xA;Third party information&#xD;&#xA;Advice about certain aspects of operations of government&#xD;&#xA;Information about testing procedures, tests, and audits&#xD;&#xA;Information that is subject to solicitor-client privilege&#xD;&#xA;Information that is subject to statutory prohibitions&#xD;&#xA;Certain types of information held by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited&#xD;&#xA;Confidences of the Queenâ€™s Privy Council for Canada&#xD;&#xA;It is highly unlikely that developers would intentionally include such information in their source code. As a result, source code is considered unclassified unless the developer has included, inadvertently or otherwise, information that falls under the items listed above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where feasible, this information should be removed from the source code to increase the ability for code to be shared."/>
