    documentation="Open Source Software licenses can provide more flexibility than a proprietary license for a digital projectâ€™s deliverables.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where the Business Requirement would benefit from the reuse of Software, the GC may acquire Software such that it may be used in subsequent projects in the GC. A Proprietary Software licensor can grant such right of re-use upon request, but by its nature, all Open Source Software is reusable and therefore compliant with this request by default."/>
