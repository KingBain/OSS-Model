    documentation="Use of open source software introduces a different model based on support services rather than obtaining software licences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two major support models for open source software are self-support, where the department or agencyâ€™s internal IT team is responsible for maintenance and interacting with the community, or professional support.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Internal&#xD;&#xA;Using a self-support model requires that the responsible teams:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Have a proper process in place to manage the evaluation and the introduction of open source software in the organization.&#xD;&#xA;Maintain and track thorough lists of all software used how and by whom.&#xD;&#xA;Ensure updates are applied in a timely fashion.&#xD;&#xA;User and developer community should be leveraged for general support questions as well as reporting bugs, creating feature requests and code contributions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When using software components for development purposes, powerful tools and services can be leveraged by IT teams to automate, facilitate and speed up the identification of these components, including open source software. These tools can provide scanning capabilities for known security vulnerabilities as well as legal compliance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Professional Services&#xD;&#xA;It is possible to enter in contract with a company for professional services to provide maintenance, updates, warranty and liability for open source software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another scenario that may become recurrent would be choosing an open source software and using the community version and later down the road going for tender for professional support and maintenance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When custom development requires the use of contracted developers, ensure that the proper rights to the source code are obtained to release as open source in accordance with the Guide for Publishing Open Source Code."/>
